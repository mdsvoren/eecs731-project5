Project Organization
------------

    ├── README.md          <- The top-level README for developers using this project.
    ├── data               <- contains the Historical_Product_Demand.csv file which holds relevant data for prediction
    │
    ├── notebooks          <- contains notebook "Project 5- Forecasting". Also contains notebook "Archive" which was a prior version of my work on this project that I decided to substantially revise, but not throw out. This is not for grading, but for the most part looks at the data in a similar way, with variance in implementation.
